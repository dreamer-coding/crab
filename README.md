# **Crab CLI**

**`crab`** is the official command-line interface for Blue CrabDB, a lightweight, portable key-value database designed for embedded systems, scripting environments, and efficient local storage. With a single executable and a suite of powerful subcommands, `crab` lets you insert, query, export, import, and manage `.crabdb` files directly from the terminal. Whether you're building automation scripts, logging sensor data, or managing configurations, `crab` offers a streamlined, shell-friendly experience with both structured and raw access modes via MyShell and NoShell. Itâ€™s small, fast, and designed to fit into your workflow like a natural extension of the UNIX philosophy.
